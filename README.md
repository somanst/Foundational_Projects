### 2. üß± Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Hands-on application of OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism) via simulations, GUIs, and management systems in Java.

- [Ball Game](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/OOP/Ball%20Game): A terminal-based tile game where a player controls a white ball that collects colored balls while navigating walls and avoiding holes. Implements object interaction, file parsing, and movement logic.
- [Duck Hunt](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/OOP/DuckHunt): A simplified version of the classic Duck Hunt game built using JavaFX. Players use mouse interaction to shoot moving targets within a GUI, enforcing event-driven logic and user input handling.
- [Library System](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/OOP/LibrarySystem): A rule-based library manager for academics and students, supporting borrowing, returning, deadline extensions, and special book rules via a command system.
- [Smart Home System](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/OOP/Smart%20Home%20System): Implements an OOP-based smart home automation simulation in Java. Devices like smart lamps, plugs, and cameras can be added, controlled, and scheduled over time using commands while respecting OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### 3. üìä Data Structures
C++ projects built around stacks, queues, trees, and spatial data structures with real-world-inspired narratives.

- [Image Processor](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/DataStructures/ImageProcessor): Matrix and image-based processing system using convolution, sharpening, and edge detection. Also includes message encoding/decoding within image data.
- [Network Application](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/DataStructures/NetworkApplication): Simulates a layered network stack (Application ‚Üí Physical) in C++, including custom protocols, routing logic, and peer-to-peer communication using stacks and queues.
- [Space Trees](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/DataStructures/SpaceTrees): Uses Binary Search Trees, Red-Black Trees, and KD-Trees to map space sectors in a science fiction narrative to aid in planetary classification and a rescue mission.
- [Testris](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/DataStructures/Testris): A Tetris-inspired game implemented in C++ using dynamic memory allocation and multi-level linked lists. Features include grid rendering, block rotation, gravity mode, and score tracking based on classic Tetris logic.

### 4. üìê Algorithms
Focused on the analysis, comparison, and application of core algorithmic paradigms including sorting, searching, scheduling, and pathfinding.

- [Algorithm Analysis](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/Algorithms/AlgorithmAnalysis): A comparative study of sorting (Insertion, Merge, Counting) and searching (Linear, Binary) algorithms over varied datasets (sorted, reverse, random), focusing on empirical time and space complexities.
- [Optimal Power Grid](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/Algorithms/OptimalPowerGrid): Solve an optimization problem involving energy distribution across a smart grid using dynamic programming and graph traversal to minimize load imbalance.
- [Project Scheduler & Shortest Path Finder](https://github.com/somanst/Foundational_Projects/tree/main/Algorithms/ProjectScheduler%26ShortestPathFinder): A scheduling and dependency resolution system for smart city infrastructure projects, using topological sort and shortest path algorithms to plan hyperloop construction.
